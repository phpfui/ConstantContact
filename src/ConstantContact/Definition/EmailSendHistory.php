 * @property int $send_id Uniquely identifies each send history object using the number of times that you sent the email campaign activity as a sequence starting at <code>1</code>. For example, when you send a specific email campaign activity twice this method returns an object with a <code>send_id</code> of 1 for the first send and an object with a <code>send_id</code> of 2 for the second send.
 * @property array $contact_list_ids The contacts lists that Constant Contact sent email campaign activity to as an array of contact <code>list_id</code> strings.
 * @property array $segment_ids The contact segments that Constant Contact sent the email campaign activity to as an array of <code>segment_id</code> integers.
 * @property int $count The number of contacts that Constant Contact sent this email campaign activity to. This property is specific to each send history object.

 * @property \PHPFUI\ConstantContact\DateTime $run_date The system generated date and time that Constant Contact sent the email campaign activity to contacts in ISO-8601 format.

 * <li><code>COMPLETED</code>: Constant Contact successfully sent the email campaign activity.</li>
 * <li><code>ERRORED</code>: Constant Contact encountered an error when sending the email campaign activity.<li> * </ul>
 * @property int $reason_code The reason why the send attempt completed or encountered an error. This method returns <code>0</code> if Constant Contact successfully sent the email campaign activity to contacts. Possible <code>reason_code</code> values are: <ul>

 * <li>3 — This Constant Contact account cannot currently send emails. This can be due to billing or product expiration.</li>
 * <li>4 — You're not able to send the email to that many contacts. Remove contacts from the contact lists you are using or select a list with fewer contacts.</li>
 * <li>5 — The email is currently in staging. For more information, see the <a href='http://knowledgebase.constantcontact.com/articles/KnowledgeBase/7402-email-staging' target='_blank>Email Staging Knowledge Base article</a>.</li>

 * <li>11 — This Constant Contact account cannot send survey invitations.</li>
 * <li>12 — Constant Contact attempted to send the email, but there were no eligible contacts to send it to. This can be caused by an invalid contact list, a contact list with no contacts, or a contact list with no new contacts during a resend.
