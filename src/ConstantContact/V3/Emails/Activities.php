	/**
	 * PUT (Update) An Email Campaign Activity
	 *
	 * Use this method to update an email campaign activity by including the
	 * complete email campaign activity with your changes in the request body.
	 * The request body requires the `from_name`, `from_email`, `reply_to_email`,
	 * and `subject` properties.
	 *
	 * You can only update email campaign activities that have the `primary_email`
	 * role and that are in `DRAFT` or `Done` status.
	 * When you use a PUT method to update a resource, the V3 API overwrites
	 * any properties that are missing in the request body. However, the V3
	 * API does not overwrite subresources that you omit in the request body
	 * or missing properties in subresources. This method considers `physical_address_in_footer`,
	 * `document_properties`, `html_content`, and `permalink_url` subresources
	 * of the email campaign activity.
	 *
	 *
	 * @param string $campaign_activity_id The unique ID for the email campaign activity you are updating.
	 * @param \PHPFUI\ConstantContact\Definition\EmailCampaignActivity $body A request body payload that contains the complete email campaign activity with your changes.
