	 *
	 * Each send history object contains the email campaign activity send date,
	 * the number of contacts it was sent to, and the contact lists or segments
	 * used to send it. Each send history object also includes if the send
	 * attempt completed or encountered an error, and the reason why each error
	 * occurred. This method returns results in ascending order starting with
	 * the first send attempt.
	 *
	 * If the email campaign activity has not been sent to contacts, this method
	 * returns a 200 response and an empty array.
	 *
