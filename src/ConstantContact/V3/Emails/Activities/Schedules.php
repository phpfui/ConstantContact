	 * POST (Create) an Email Campaign Activity Schedule

	 * campaign activity to contacts. Use the `scheduled_date` request body
	 * property to enter the ISO-8601 format date that you want Constant Contact
	 * to send the email campaign activity on.
	 *
	 * Before you schedule an email campaign activity, you must update the
	 * email campaign activity and specify which contacts you want Constant
	 * Contact to send the email to. When you make a PUT call to update an
	 * email campaign activity, use the `contact_list_ids` or `segment_ids`
	 * array to add contacts.
	 *
	 * You can only schedule email campaign activities that have the `primary_email`
	 * role and are in `DRAFT`, `DONE`, or `ERROR` status. When you schedule
	 * an email campaign activity in `DONE` status, Constant Contact does not
	 * send the email campaign activity to contacts that already received it.
	 * Constant Contact only sends the email campaign activity to any new contacts
	 * in the contact lists or segment you use.
	 *
	 *
	 * @param string $campaign_activity_id The unique ID for an email campaign activity. You can only schedule email campaign activities that have the `primary_email` role.
	 * @param \PHPFUI\ConstantContact\Definition\EmailScheduleInput $body A request body payload that contains the date that you want Constant Contact to send your email campaign activity on. Use `"0"` as the date to have Constant Contact immediately send the email campaign activity.
