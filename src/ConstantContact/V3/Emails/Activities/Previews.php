	 * GET the HTML Preview of an Email Campaign Activity

	 * Use this method to get the HTML preview of an email campaign activity.
	 * The HTML preview allows you to verify how the email campaign activity

	 *
	 * Custom code emails (`format_type` 5) use the Constant Contact account
	 * owner's contact information to process contact, custom field, and account
	 * variables in the preview.
	 *
	 * This method returns the HTML preview encoded as a JSON string. You will
	 * need to decode the string before you can use it as valid HTML.
	 *
	 *
	 * @param string $campaign_activity_id The unique ID for an email campaign activity.
