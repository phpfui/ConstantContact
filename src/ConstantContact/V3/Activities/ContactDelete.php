	 * Delete Contacts in Bulk
	 *
	 * Use this endpoint to bulk delete contacts in an account. Contacts to
	 * delete are specified by contact_id (up to 500), or by list_id (up to
	 * 50 lists); all contacts that are members of the list_ids are deleted.
	 * Deleted contacts won’t receive email from you, and they don’t count
	 * as active contacts. Unlike unsubscribed contacts, deleted contacts can
	 * be added back to an account. [Learn how to revive deleted contacts](https://v3.developer.constantcontact.com/api_guide/contacts_delete.html#revive).
